# Product Context

## Why Cafedelia Exists

### The Claude Code Interface Problem
Claude Code is incredibly powerful but lacks proper session management:

**Claude Code's Strengths**:
- Sophisticated AI agent with deep codebase understanding
- Advanced file manipulation and code generation
- Git integration and project awareness
- Support for multiple AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus)

**Claude Code's Interface Limitations**:
- **Primitive CLI**: Manual session ID management with `--resume`
- **No Session Visibility**: Can't see what sessions exist or their status
- **Poor Organization**: No project-based grouping or session categorization
- **No Progress Tracking**: Sessions are "black boxes" with no visibility into progress

### The Gap Cafedelia Fills
**Missing**: A proper GUI interface for Claude Code session management.

Cafedelia provides the visual interface and session intelligence that Claude Code should have had from the beginning, using Elia's proven Textual framework as the foundation.

## Problems Cafedelia Solves

### 1. **Session Discovery and Management**
**Current State**: Claude Code sessions are invisible
- `claude code --resume <session-id>` requires knowing session IDs
- No way to browse available sessions
- No visual indication of session status or activity

**Cafedelia Solution**: Visual session browser with metadata
- Discover all Claude Code sessions from `~/.claude/__store.db`
- Display sessions with project context, timestamps, and activity
- One-click session attachment without memorizing IDs

### 2. **Model Configuration and Selection**
**Current State**: Claude Code model configuration is opaque
- No visual way to see available models
- Model switching requires command-line flags
- No persistent model preferences per project

**Cafedelia Solution**: GUI for Claude Code model management
- Visual selection of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus models
- Project-specific model preferences
- Real-time model configuration without CLI arguments

### 3. **Session Intelligence and Progress**
**Current State**: Claude Code sessions are "black boxes"
- No visibility into what the session has accomplished
- No progress tracking or session summaries
- No way to understand session history without scrolling

**Cafedelia Solution**: Session intelligence and monitoring
- Parse session history for progress summaries
- Track file modifications and achievements
- Visual indicators of session health and activity status

### 4. **Workflow Orchestration Limitation**
**Current State**: Manual session coordination
- No automated handoffs between sessions
- No project-level session organization
- No git worktree integration for parallel development

**Cafedelia Solution**: Orchestrated workflow management
- Project-based session grouping
- Git worktree integration for parallel contexts
- Background task delegation and coordination

## User Experience Goals

### Primary User Journey
```
Developer Working on Feature:
1. Open Cafedelia (instead of basic claude code)
2. Browse existing sessions by project/context  
3. Select relevant session or create new one
4. Work in embedded tmux Claude Code session
5. Monitor background sessions with intelligence summaries
6. Delegate related tasks to appropriate sessions
7. Switch between sessions without losing context
```

### Key Experience Principles

**Stay in Terminal**: Never force context switching to desktop apps
**Preserve Workflow**: Work with existing tmux/terminal setup, don't replace it  
**Add Intelligence**: Layer session insights on top of existing Claude Code power
**Visual Polish**: Maintain Elia's beautiful Textual interface standards

## Target Audience

### Primary: Terminal-Native Developers
- Live in terminal environment
- Use tmux or similar multiplexers
- Want AI assistance without workflow disruption
- Value both aesthetics and functionality

### Secondary: AI-Assisted Development Teams
- Work with multiple Claude Code sessions
- Need session coordination and handoffs
- Want background monitoring of AI progress
- Require project-level organization

### Personas

**"Terminal Power User"**:
- Spends 8+ hours in terminal daily
- Has sophisticated tmux configurations  
- Wants AI tools to integrate seamlessly
- Values keyboard-driven interfaces

**"AI Workflow Manager"**:
- Runs multiple parallel AI sessions
- Needs session intelligence and coordination
- Wants background monitoring capabilities
- Requires project-level organization

## Competitive Positioning

### vs Pure Elia
**Elia**: Beautiful chat interface, limited to API conversations
**Cafedelia**: Same beautiful interface + serious workflow management + CLI tool integration

### vs Desktop Session Managers (Crystal, Conductor)
**Desktop Tools**: Rich UI but requires context switching from terminal
**Cafedelia**: Terminal-native with equivalent functionality, preserves developer flow

### vs Terminal Chat Tools (All Rust/Ratatui-based)
**Rust Tools**: Basic chat interfaces, no session management
**Cafedelia**: Textual framework + session intelligence + workflow orchestration

### vs Direct Claude Code Usage
**Claude Code**: Powerful agent, primitive session management
**Cafedelia**: Same power + visual session management + intelligence layer + coordination
